# RhymeTime Games: Project Overview & Current Status

This document outlines the **completed evolution** of the Noctua project into **RhymeTime Games** and its current status as a production-ready **Rhyme Mahjong MVP**.

## 1. Project Evolution: From Observatory to Rhyme Mahjong

The project has **successfully completed** a major transformation from the original Observatory/Scriptorium concept into a focused, production-ready game.

**Our completed mission**: Create a **Rhyme Mahjong MVP** that repurposes the sophisticated Observatory linguistic analysis engine as a rhyme detection system for 3D tile-matching gameplay.

### âœ… Core Innovation Achieved
- **Repurposed Analysis Engine**: Observatory pattern recognition now detects exact and slant rhymes for tile matching
- **3D Pyramid Layouts**: Traditional Mahjong exposure mechanics with rhyme-based connections
- **Star Progression System**: Complete 0-155 stars across 10 title tiers  
- **English-Only Focus**: Simplified from 13+ language support for MVP launch
