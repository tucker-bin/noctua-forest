# Noctua Forest - Next Steps for Production Launch

## 🚨 Critical Issues to Resolve

### 1. Build System Fix
**Issue**: "Too many open files" error preventing production builds on Windows
**Solutions to try**:
```bash
# Option 1: Increase file handle limit (PowerShell as Admin)
ulimit -n 4096

# Option 2: Use WSL for building
wsl
cd /mnt/c/Users/User/new\ project/noctua-forest
npm run build

# Option 3: Build on different machine/CI
# Push to GitHub and use CI/CD pipeline
```

### 2. PWA Workbox Dependency
**Issue**: workbox-build resolution error
**Solutions to try**:
```bash
# Option 1: Reinstall with specific version
npm uninstall vite-plugin-pwa
npm install vite-plugin-pwa@0.16.7 --save-dev

# Option 2: Use alternative PWA plugin
npm install @vite-pwa/vite-plugin-pwa --save-dev

# Option 3: Manual service worker setup
# Create custom service worker without plugin
```
