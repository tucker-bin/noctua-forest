Excellent design document! Here are the AI Development Rules for the Noctua Rhyme Observatory based on your architectural vision:
ðŸ¦‰ NOCTUA RHYME OBSERVATORY - AI DEVELOPMENT RULES
CORE PHILOSOPHY RULES
Rule 1: Thematic Consistency
ALL interactions must reinforce the "night observatory" metaphor
Use astronomy/owl-related terminology: "Observe" not "Analyze", "Observations" not "Projects", "Wisdom Points" not "XP"
Maintain the feeling of "entering a magical space for creative exploration"
Rule 2: Orion Integration Requirements
Orion the Owl is NEVER just decorative - he must serve functional purposes
Required Orion appearances: Loading states, onboarding guidance, success confirmations, help tooltips
Orion must "fly" between UI elements during guided interactions
Orion's mood should reflect user state (happy for success, thoughtful for analysis)
Rule 3: Dark-Mode First Architecture
Primary background MUST be #0D1117 (Deep Indigo)
Secondary surfaces MUST be #161B22 (Midnight Blue)
Text MUST be #E6EDF3 (Moonbeam) for readability
Bright elements should "glow" against the dark background
COLOR PALETTE ENFORCEMENT
Rule 4: Strict Color Usage
Apply to production-f...
LAYOUT & INTERACTION RULES
Rule 5: Three-Panel Layout
Left: "Project Nest" (saved observations, projects)
Center: "Observatory" (main text editor and analysis)
Right: "Control Deck" (pattern controls, settings)
Use 8px grid system for ALL spacing and alignment
Rule 6: Focus Mode Behavior
When user is typing, reduce opacity of non-essential UI by 20%
Text cursor must have soft blue glow effect
Maintain distraction-free writing environment
Rule 7: Interactive Text Requirements
Hover: Highlighted words brighten, related words pulse with soft glow
Click: Opens dark glass popover with backdrop-filter blur
Tooltip: Instant appearance with phonetic data in clean typography
Transitions: All animations must be smooth and spring-based
GAMIFICATION SYSTEM RULES
Rule 8: Wisdom Points (WP) System
Replace all "XP" references with "Wisdom Points"
Progress bar MUST be lunar cycle visualization (new moon â†’ full moon)
Level up triggers full-moon animation
Achievements are "Constellations" not badges
Rule 9: User Journey States
Apply to production-f...
COMPONENT BEHAVIOR RULES
Rule 10: Onboarding Modal
Must dim main UI with overlay
Orion "flies" between interactive elements with fluid animation
Speech bubbles styled as clean, modern tooltips
Interactive tutorial, NOT carousel format
Rule 11: Control Deck Interactions
Accordion menus expand with springy animation
Toggles are custom "lunar phase" switches:
Off: Empty circle outline
On: Filled with corresponding highlight color + glowing aura
Rule 12: Button Hierarchy
Primary CTA: vibrantGold (#F7B538) - "Begin Observing", "Observe"
Secondary: brightSkyBlue (#58A6FF) - Links, secondary actions
Destructive: Only use when absolutely necessary, maintain theme
CONTENT & MESSAGING RULES
Rule 13: Voice & Tone
Use observatory/astronomy metaphors consistently
"Observe" your text, "Discover" patterns, "Explore" connections
Maintain sense of wonder and magical discovery
Educational but not academic - approachable wisdom
Rule 14: Error States & Feedback
Errors should feel like "cloudy observation conditions" not failures
Success states show brief happy Orion animation
Loading states always include Orion's blinking eyes animation
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES
Rule 15: Animation Standards
Use backdrop-filter: blur(10px) for glass effects
All transitions: transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)
Glowing effects: Use box-shadow with color-matched rgba values
Orion animations: Smooth SVG transforms, maximum 1.5s duration
Rule 16: Accessibility Within Theme
Maintain WCAG contrast ratios despite dark theme
Ensure all interactive elements have clear focus states
Provide alt text for Orion in all states
Support reduced motion preferences
FEATURE PRESERVATION MANDATE
Rule 17: Feature Protection
NEVER remove existing functionality during "cleanup"
Google Sign-In, gamification, Orion animations, pattern controls - ALL must remain
If TypeScript errors occur, fix with proper types, not feature removal
Maintain token system, usage tracking, admin capabilities
INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS
Rule 18: Firebase & Backend
All API calls must maintain token-based authentication
Usage tracking integration required for Wisdom Points
Admin panel must maintain Noctua theme consistency
Social sharing must include pre-populated messages with observatory branding
ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST FOR AI:
[ ] Verify all colors match exact hex values
[ ] Confirm Orion appears in required interaction states
[ ] Test lunar cycle progress visualization
[ ] Validate three-panel responsive layout
[ ] Ensure all CTAs use proper terminology ("Observe" not "Analyze")
[ ] Check glass blur effects on popovers
[ ] Verify focus mode opacity changes
[ ] Test constellation achievement unlocks
These rules ensure any AI working on the project maintains the magical, cohesive Noctua experience you've architected! ðŸŒ™âœ¨
