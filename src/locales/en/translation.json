    },
    "pattern_types": {
      "question": "What types of patterns can Noctua find?",
      "answer": "Noctua can identify several types of sound patterns:\n- Rhymes (end rhymes and internal rhymes)\n- Assonance (repeated vowel sounds)\n- Consonance (repeated consonant sounds)\n- Alliteration (repeated initial sounds)\n- Rhythmic patterns (stress patterns)"
    },
    "batch_processing": {
      "question": "Can I analyze multiple texts at once?",
