# Understanding Sound Patterns in Noctua Forest

## Universal Sound Patterns

These patterns are found across many languages, though their specific manifestations may vary:

### Rhyme Patterns
- **End Rhyme**: Matching sounds at the ends of words/lines
- **Slant Rhyme**: Similar but not identical sounds
- **Internal Rhyme**: Rhyming words within the same line

### Sound Harmony
- **Assonance**: Repeated vowel sounds
- **Consonance**: Repeated consonant sounds
- **Alliteration**: Repeated initial sounds
- **Sibilance**: Patterns of 's' and similar sounds
- **Liquid Sounds**: Flowing sounds (l, r)
- **Nasal Sounds**: Resonant sounds (m, n, ng)

### Rhythm and Meter
- **Basic Rhythm**: Regular sound patterns
- **Meter**: Specific stress patterns
- **Caesura**: Natural pauses
- **Enjambment**: Line continuation

## Language-Specific Patterns

#### Structure Patterns
- **Four-Character Expressions** (四字成语)
  - Balanced structure
  - Historical/cultural references
- **Reduplication**
  - AA patterns (identical repetition)
